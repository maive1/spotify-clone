# Project: Basic Spotify Clone

## Description

This is a personal practice project where I created a basic Spotify clone using Astro. The project allows playback of songs stored in the `public` folder, and these songs are from the YouTube Audio Library.

## Features

- Audio playback from local files.
- Basic interface similar to Spotify.
- Playlist with songs from the YouTube Audio Library.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd spotify-clone
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   yarn astro dev
   ```
